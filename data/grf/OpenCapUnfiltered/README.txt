Automatic processing achieved the following marker errors (averaged
over all frames of all trials):

 - RMSE: 1.20cm, Max: 3.54cm

The following trials were processed to perform automatic body scaling
and marker registration:

 - MarkerData/DJ5.trc (RMSE: 1.25cm, Max: 4.25cm)
     1 Worst Marker "L_Shoulder" (RMSE: 4.71cm)
     2 Worst Marker "R_Shoulder" (RMSE: 4.68cm)
     3 Worst Marker "L_Sternum" (RMSE: 1.91cm)
     4 Worst Marker "r.ASIS" (RMSE: 1.91cm)
     5 Worst Marker "C7" (RMSE: 1.72cm)

The model file containing optimal body scaling and marker offsets is:

Models/optimized_scale_and_markers.osim

This tool works by finding an optimal scaling and an optimal marker
offsets at the same time.

If you want to manually edit the marker offsets, you can modify the
<MarkerSet> in "Models/unscaled_but_with_optimized_markers.osim" (by
default this file contains the marker offsets found by the optimizer).
If you want to tweak the Scaling, you can edit
"Models/rescaling_setup.xml". If you change either of these files,
then run (FROM THIS FOLDER, and not including the leading "> "):

 > opensim-cmd run-tool Models/rescaling_setup.xml
           # This will re-generate Models/optimized_scale_and_markers.osim


You do not need to re-run Inverse Kinematics unless you change
scaling, because the output motion files are already generated for you
as "*_ik.mot" files for each trial, but you are welcome to confirm our
results using OpenSim. To re-run Inverse Kinematics with OpenSim, to
verify the results of AddBiomechanics, you can use the automatically
generated XML configuration files. Here are the command-line commands
you can run (FROM THIS FOLDER, and not including the leading "> ") to
verify IK results for each trial:

 > opensim-cmd run-tool IK/DJ5_ik_setup.xml
           # This will create a results file IK/DJ5_ik_by_opensim.mot
 > opensim-cmd run-tool IK/DJ1_ik_setup.xml
           # This will create a results file IK/DJ1_ik_by_opensim.mot
 > opensim-cmd run-tool IK/walking2_ik_setup.xml
           # This will create a results file IK/walking2_ik_by_opensim.mot
 > opensim-cmd run-tool IK/walking3_ik_setup.xml
           # This will create a results file IK/walking3_ik_by_opensim.mot
 > opensim-cmd run-tool IK/DJ4_ik_setup.xml
           # This will create a results file IK/DJ4_ik_by_opensim.mot
 > opensim-cmd run-tool IK/walking4_ik_setup.xml
           # This will create a results file IK/walking4_ik_by_opensim.mot


To run Inverse Dynamics with OpenSim, you can also use automatically
generated XML configuration files. WARNING: Inverse Dynamics is not
yet fully supported by AddBiomechanics, and so the mapping of force-
plates to feet is not perfect. The default XML files assign each force
plate to the `calcn_*` body that gets closest to it during the motion
trial. THIS MAY NOT BE CORRECT! That said, hopefully this is at least
a useful starting point for you to edit from. The following commands
should work (FROM THIS FOLDER, and not including the leading "> "):

 > opensim-cmd run-tool ID/DJ5_id_setup.xml
           # This will create a results file ID/DJ5_id.sto
 > opensim-cmd run-tool ID/DJ1_id_setup.xml
           # This will create a results file ID/DJ1_id.sto
 > opensim-cmd run-tool ID/walking2_id_setup.xml
           # This will create a results file ID/walking2_id.sto
 > opensim-cmd run-tool ID/walking3_id_setup.xml
           # This will create a results file ID/walking3_id.sto
 > opensim-cmd run-tool ID/DJ4_id_setup.xml
           # This will create a results file ID/DJ4_id.sto
 > opensim-cmd run-tool ID/walking4_id_setup.xml
           # This will create a results file ID/walking4_id.sto


The original unscaled model file is present in:

Models/unscaled_generic.osim

There is also an unscaled model, with markers moved to spots found by
this tool, at:

Models/unscaled_but_with_optimized_markers.osim
